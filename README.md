## 🧠 About Cybero

Cybero acts as a personal cybersecurity guide. Users can ask questions such as *“What is SOC?”*, *“What is malware?”*, or *“Tell me more”*, and Cybero responds with easy-to-understand explanations. It remembers the context of the conversation, allowing natural follow-up questions without repeating the topic.

Unlike most chatbots, Cybero does not rely on paid APIs or internet access. All intelligence is local and predictable.
